<h1 align="center">🎨 J Davies Creative</h1>

A single-page web portfolio that showcases my hobbie as an artist. The focus of this project was to build an engaging front-end that offers an immersive user experience. And also to practice using React.js and responsive CSS design on a personal project.

## Project Reflection
I enjoyed using my own artwork in a project over random stock photos. The project merges my passions, showcasing the creative and problem-sovling sides of me. It also pays homage to where I first disscovered a passion for coding; customising my orriginal *Squarespace* portfolio, which this project will replace, giving me full creative controll.  
This project can also serve as a useful template to quickly build a front-end for future projects.

The landing page was added to improve visitor immersion & also because it loads faster than the gallery; hiding content jumps as images load in.

The page is ordered into clearly defined sections, using big header elements and the navigation bar allows returning users to quickly jump to a section.

Using React.js helped break down the app into simple components and multiple files when compared to a single lenghthy HTML file.

I used a package to add the text fade-in annimations. I concidered coding this myself but after research it felt like I would be copying too much code. for now, as there are already good packages available, I thought to save time rather than focusing on a minor additional feature.

I allowed myself to spend longer developing the front-end than on previous projects. Adding subtle features which are not essential to functionality, such as smooth scrolling, box shaddows and navigation buttons. But, when combined, notably enhance the users experience.

### Why use a single-page website
Single-page Websites are not suited for every situation but for a Portfolio; this web structure offers a seamless storytelling experience. Their simple navigation orders the presentation of infomation in an intuitive way and scrolling provides an immersive user journey without distractions or breaks.
  
There are risks of longer loading times and fewer clicks to measure viewer engagement by. However, focusing solely on pageviews & clicks as the only metric for success can encourage clickbait and poor design. Which in turn, leads to shorter visitor engagement and reduces the returning audience. It is important to consider your average viewer and focus on holding their attention after that first click.

### Development Ideas
This is a project I will likely continue to develop. Given more time, here is a list of features I would like to implement:  
- Mobile layout optimisation, including a drop-down navigation menu.
- carousel gallery?
- lightbox feature.
- SEO Optimisation - title tag, meta description, and URL.  
- host with a professional domain name / URL.  
- create a button to switch between light and dark mode theme?
