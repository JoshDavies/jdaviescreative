## Project Goals

- Learn features to present web content in best way possible.
- CSS.
- React.js & JSX.

## Project Reflection
### TODO / ideas for development
Navigation Bar
- right align or change to a dropdown menu?

- Mobile CSS layout Optimisation. I didn't use a CSS Framework because I wanted to learn pure CSS. Downside to this is that the site is not currently responsive
for small screens.  Bootstrap would help with responsive layout.  

- carousel gallery
- click image to open lightbox (full-screen)
- upload more artwork

- host with a professional domain name / URL.

- very static - add more transition animations

- create a button to switch between light and dark mode theme?

- SEO consideration

âœ… smooth scrolling  
âœ… add navigation arrows.

- include a new section that loads articles I've written about my work process.

### Why use a single page webpage.
Brochure / Portfolio sites are suited to this web Structure as it is small enough in scale to achievably showcase all the information visitors will want.  
Able to create a more engaging website using a single page.     
formatted into clearly defined sections with big header elements.  
capture visitorsâ€™ attention.  
Custom scrolling / transition effects to tell story more engagingly.  

simple navigation - controls the users journey / experience.   
present information in a logical order.  
easier for visitors to find what theyâ€™re looking for.   

Landing pages. This type of website is all about converting users. Limiting yourself to one page enables you to craft a narrative without any distractions,  
initial load will be slower but then
navigating to another sections is very responsive as it has already loaded.  
feels like a native mobile app. once loaded it is connectivity independent.
landing page loads faster  
gallery takes a while to load in (refresh will looking at it and you will notice the images jump about as they adjust to the galleries constraints).  
less information to sort through, chances are visitors will pay more attention to content. - higher engagement

Using React.js helped break down the app into simpler components and multiple files.
