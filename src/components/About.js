      <h3>Artist Profile </h3>
      <p>
        I am a London based graduate of Arts University Bournemouth.
        Inspired by a fusion of photography, memory & imagination to create atmospheric
        watercolour & ink illustrations. My techniques are influenced by traditional
        watercolours but have developed into my own contemporary style.
        <br />
        Fascinated by both the serenity of nature & energy of urban architecture, my work studies the character of these opposing environments, evoking how we are influence by our surroundings.
